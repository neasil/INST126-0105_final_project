This program allows you to enter the link to a Wikipedia page and count the number of times 
that your given words appear. The counts will be stored in a .csv file which will then be
graphed into either a scatterplot, barplot, or lineplot. 

To use the program, please follow the on-screen prompt and enter the link to your chosen 
Wikipedia page, any words you'd like to count, and what type of visualization you'd like to 
display (scatterplot, barplot, lineplot).
